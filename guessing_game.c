Description: C program that implements a number guessing game. The computer generates
random number in the range 1 to 20 (inclusive). The program  prompt the
player repeatedly to enter a guess and then respond with one of the following messages:
                    â€¢ "Too high!" if the guess is greater than the secret number.
                    â€¢ "Too low!" if the guess is less than the secret number.
                    â€¢ "Congratulations!" if the guess is equal to the secret number.
The program must also count and display the total number of attempts it took for the player to
guess correctly.
